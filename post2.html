        <div class="content-container">
            <p>I've often thought that it takes a certain amount of strength to experience our feelings. Some feelings are generally positive, such as excitement, joy, and serenity. Others are downright painful. Be they positive or painful, they do a lot for us. They're very telling and often helpful. Even anger has its place at the table. Anger can tell us when our boundaries have been crossed, or protect us from other difficult feelings (such as sadness). I think they get a bad rep honestly, but knowing our feelings helps us learn how to deal with them.</p>
            <p>The more that we become aware of our feelings, the sooner we can learn to navigate them. This is particularly important, as it can be easy to "jump down the rabbit hole," so to speak.</p>
            <p>It's part of being human. A big feeling comes up (anger, sadness, hurt) and we get stuck in it. Not only do we get stuck, sometimes we dwell on the feelings until they actually get stronger!</p>
            <p>Avoiding feelings is a great band-aid, but band-aids don't heal wounds that call for stitches. So what do we do?</p>
            <p>We start naming and noticing our feelings until it becomes second nature. As we become more proficient at noticing our emotions earlier, we start learning how to deal with them. That's where I come in. It's my job to give you the tools to do just that.</p>
            <p>So let's say you've learned how to name your feelings, you start noticing them sooner, and start dealing with them before they become overwhelming. You may find yourself less likely to feel reactive when those difficult feelings come up. Of course, the result of this may mean calmer relationships and maybe even feeling better in your day-to-day life.</p>
            <p>It all starts with that first step.</p>
