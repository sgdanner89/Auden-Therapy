        <div class="content-container">
            <p>A common misnomer about therapy is that it's "just talking." The misconception is that therapy is a place where you go to tell someone else about your troubles, then pay and leave none the better.</p>
            <p>What if it was more than that? Like many things in our lives, there's more beneath the surface than meets the naked eye.</p>
            <p>It's true, therapy does involve talking. It's also true that therapy is work. As a therapist, my job is to sit with you in your moments of difficulty; helping you sift through the thoughts, feelings, and experiences that you have.</p>
            <p>Maybe it really isn't all about your childhood or your parents. Maybe it's about the here-and-now. All of the perfectly normal human experiences, such as pain, love, anger, anxiety, feelings of overwhelm. It's not just about looking at what happened or talking about feelings, although that is part of it. It's about learning what we can do with those feelings or experiences, and learning ways to help ourselves find balance, serenity, or even joy.</p>
